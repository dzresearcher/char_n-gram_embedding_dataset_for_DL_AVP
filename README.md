# char_n-gram_embedding_dataset_for_DL_AVP
In this repository, we make publicully available the source codes (Java and C++) of the tool used to prepare the dataset and also to carry out the exprimental evaluation in the research work :
"EFFICIENT DEEP FEATURES LEARNING FOR VULNERABILITY DETECTION USING CHARACTER N-GRAM EMBEDDING"

Because the size of the files related to the embedding models (generated by fastText tool) and the proposed dataset (arff format) is very big to uploaded here, we made them available in a shared google drive folder at this adresse :
